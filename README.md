#Birthday and entrey date email reminder

This module creates a scheduler that will run every day a method that looks for birthdays or entry date anniversary (at AbAKUS) of employees.
This method works if there are several employees who have their birthday on the same day. When a match is found, a message is generated and sent by email to employees specified as managers.

This module has been developed by Bernard Delhez, intern @ AbAKUS it-solutions, under the control of Valentin Thirion.
